# apk-locator

A VS Code extension that effortlessly find and open the enclosing folder of your generated apk files. 

## Why do i need this?

If you are tired of manually searching for the generated apk file every time you launch a build in VS Code you might want to give this a try, I hope this can make your life easier too 🙂

Inspired by "Locate" function of Android Studio, this should be particularly useful with React Native projects, but you can use it with native project too
